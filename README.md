## Lessons Learned

While working on this project, I gained valuable knowledge and skills that significantly contributed to my development as a Front-End developer:

I expanded my skill set by diving into Sass, a powerful CSS preprocessor. This allowed me to write more efficient and maintainable stylesheets.

I focused on creating a responsive design, ensuring that the website functions seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes. This experience enhanced my understanding of responsive web design principles.

I integrated a user-friendly form using Formspree's API, improving user interaction and data collection on the website.

I took great care in designing the website, prioritising aesthetics while maintaining a clean and user-friendly interface. This project allowed me to explore and enhance my design skills.

Building this website gave me the creative freedom to experiment with different design elements and layouts, enabling me to bring my artistic vision to life.
